## Trie Data Structure

- This project takes in an sentence array consisting of any words from
  the range [a..z]

- With the sentence array, create a trie data structure and use it to
  make a auto complete function which auto completes prompts of a
  user based on the sentence array.
- The word with highest frequency will be the word to be auto completed
  based on the prompt of the users. For example, sentences = [abc, abc, ab,
  cde, cz] and prompt = 'ab', return abc as it has highest frequency.
- If frequency of ab = abc, return the word with the smaller lexicographical order
