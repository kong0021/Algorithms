## Ford Fulkerson algorithm

- Algorithm used to solve max-flow min-cut problems.
- Given a network with vertices and edges (Graph)
- Find the amount of flow that can be processed by network
  
- In my case used to process backups as fast as possible
  into different data centres connected by network
  communication channels.
- The goals is to find the maximum possible throughput of
  data from the origin data centre to its specified
  target data centres.
