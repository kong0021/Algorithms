## Dijkstra algorithm

- Algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in weighted graphs
As a smart student you are always trying to optimise the driving time to your early morning
algorithms lectures so that you can sleep more. You will be leveraging your algorithms skills
to get an optimal solution.

- Some roads have carpool lanes which means that only cars that have at least 2 passengers
are able to use it.

- The idea is to find the shortest path with the shortest driving time given a starting point
and destination of a location accompanied with the time taken to travel to that location alone
in integer, as well as the time taken to travel to the location when carpooling.
